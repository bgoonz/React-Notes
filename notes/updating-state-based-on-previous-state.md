# Exercise: Updating State Based On Older State

Your task is to build a **basic counter** that should **increment** whenever the "Increment" button is clicked.

Whilst this task allows you to **apply your general knowledge** about event handling and state (which you already practiced quite a bit at this point in the course), there's also **one crucial new aspect**: You should update the state following React **best practices**!

**Important**: Unfortunately, there's no way of automatically testing whether you used the best practice approach or not. Hence you should take a look at the "Solution explanation" to make sure you solved this task in the best possible way.

*Also make sure to use React.useState() instead of just useState() as the latter might fail in Udemy's code environment!*
